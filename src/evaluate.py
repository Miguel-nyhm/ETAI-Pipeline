evaluate.py -- Week 7: probability-based, multi-metric evaluation.

Cross-validation now returns out-of-fold *probabilities* (not just a label per row) and the
validation score of *every* metric in the config, so one run reports accuracy, ROC-AUC, recall
and the rest side by side. `selection_metric` is the one tuning maximises and runs are ranked
by. The reports (classification report, fairness) turn probabilities into labels at a threshold.
